## Note
All work done within two Jupyter notebooks:
- **For Preprocessing:**<br/>
  1- [Data Preprocessing](https://github.com/amjadalth/Hotel-Reviews-Unsupervised-NLP-Project/blob/main/Jupyter%20Notebooks/DataPreprocessing.ipynb)<br/>
  
- **For Topic Modeling:** <br/>
  2- [Topic Modeling](https://github.com/amjadalth/Hotel-Reviews-Unsupervised-NLP-Project/blob/main/Jupyter%20Notebooks/topic_modeling%20.ipynb)<br/>

The two notebooks depend on each other so, they should be run sequentially as they number.
